# Maze Chaser

Maze Chaser is a simplistic game developed as an example for students. It uses no imported assets and is playable using mouse, keyboard, or gamepad, or touch screen.

## How To Play

### Scenario

Navigate the maze while avoiding enemies! Each time you collect an orb, your score will increase by 1 and another orb will appear, but watch out. Enemies are in the maze, too! Enemies can collect orbs as well, but when one of them does, your score will decrease instead! If you touch an enemy, it's game over!

If you're playing on desktop, try clicking the fullscreen button! (This should also work on mobile in portrait or landscape mode, but performance may vary.)

### Controls

#### Desktop
